# Which is the fastest?

This is a fork of Taichiro Suzuki's "[Which is the fastest?](https://github.com/tbrand/which_is_the_fastest)" benchmarks, designed for use as a performance test when working on the HTTP modules.

See Development section when you want to add new languages or frameworks.

## The rule

We want to know the response time, not a usability. So full-stack framework is at a disadvantage.
 - Each server has no special logics.
 - Each server's executable is named as `server_[Lauguage]_[Framework]`. (For example, `server_ruby_sinatra`)
 - There are only 3 routes
   - GET  '/'         return status code 200 with empty body
   - GET  '/user/:id' return status code 200 with the id
   - POST '/user'     return status code 200 with empty body

## Installation

Required environment -> See **Current target frameworks(middlewares)**

### By using Neph

[Neph](https://github.com/tbrand/neph) is a modern command line job processor that can be substitute for `make` command.

To compile servers and benchmarker,
```
> neph
```
For each language,
```
> neph -j ruby
```
For each framework,
```
> neph -j rails
```

See [neph.yml](https://github.com/tbrand/which_is_the_fastest/blob/master/neph.yml)

### By using make

To compile servers and benchmarker,
```
> make
```
For each language,
```
> make ruby
```
For each framework,
```
> make rails
```

## Usage

You can take a benchmark by
```bash
> bin/benchmarker
```

For each language
```bash
> bin/benchmarker ruby
```

For each framework
```bash
> bin/benchmarker rails
```

For comparison (Comparing rails, kemal and router.cr in this example)
```bash
> bin/benchmarker rails crystal
```

If you take it manually, you can run each server by
```bash
> bin/server_[Language]_[Framework]
```

and run client by
```bash
> time bin/client
```

You can set # of threads and # of the loops of the request(there are 3 requests in a loop) by
```bash
> time bin/client -t 16 -r 1000
```
In the above example, 16 threads requests 1000 * 3 times.
So 48000 requests are sent in total.

## Using Docker
Setup servers by using `docker` is under **WIP**. Currently, crystal and ruby servers are supported. For example
```bash
docker-compose up rails
```

Then you can run your client by
```bash
time ./bin/client
```
## Development
 - **Give me PR when you want to add other web frameworks**
 - **Give me PR when you can tuning each framework (under the rule)**

### Where should I modify when adding new framework
 - `/[language]/[framework]/[codes]` <- Project iteself
 - `benchmarker/benchmarker.cr` <- Adding it as a target to
 - `README.md` <- Adding it as a target framework of the list
 - `Makefile`
 - `neph.yml` (optional)

Anyway, you don't have to care about details since maintainer can fix them after merging it. The result will be updated by maintainer.
